You are helping me build a personal finance / budgeting web app (like Copilot) called "BudgetPilot".

Your role:
Act as a senior full stack engineer mentoring a junior dev. I can code a bit, but I have almost no experience structuring full projects. 
You must keep the code clean and understandable, and explain what you are doing in simple terms through comments and short notes 
in the files you create.

=== PROJECT GOAL (FOR NOW: STEP 1 ONLY) ===
Right now we are ONLY doing Step 1: bootstrap the project.

Do NOT implement auth, database, Plaid, or Teller yet. Just set up a solid, modern base project that is ready for those features later.

The goal of Step 1 is:
1. Create a modern Next.js app (App Router) with TypeScript.
2. Configure Tailwind CSS for styling.
3. Set up a simple, clean layout and page structure for a future dashboard.
4. Add basic components and placeholder pages for:
   - Landing page
   - Dashboard shell
   - Navigation sidebar or top nav
5. Add clear comments so I can understand how the project is structured.

=== TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS ===
Use the following choices:

- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router) with TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Package manager: npm or pnpm (pick one and be consistent)
- Code style: idiomatic React with functional components and hooks
- File-based routing: Next.js "app" directory

Later we will add:
- Auth: Auth.js (NextAuth) with credentials (email + password)
- Database: PostgreSQL via Prisma (likely Supabase or Neon)
- Bank data: Plaid or Teller sandbox
For now, just prepare the structure where these things will fit.

=== WHAT TO CREATE IN STEP 1 ===

1. PROJECT SCAFFOLD
   - Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript and the App Router.
   - Integrate Tailwind CSS.
   - Make sure the default layout and globals are wired correctly.

2. FILE STRUCTURE
   Use an "app" directory with something like:

   - app/
     - layout.tsx
     - page.tsx                (landing page)
     - dashboard/
       - page.tsx              (main dashboard shell)
   - components/
     - Navbar.tsx
     - Sidebar.tsx
     - DashboardShell.tsx
   - styles/
     - globals.css             (if not already created by Next)
   - lib/
     - (empty or placeholder for now, we will use this later)

   This is a suggestion. If you adjust the structure, keep it simple and explain why in comments or a short note.

3. LANDING PAGE
   - A simple marketing-style page at "/" that:
     - Explains that BudgetPilot is a personal finance and budgeting app.
     - Has a main call to action button (for now it can just link to "/dashboard").
   - Use Tailwind to make it look clean and modern but do not overcomplicate the design.

4. DASHBOARD SHELL
   - Create a protected-feeling dashboard layout at "/dashboard" (even though auth is not implemented yet).
   - Include:
     - A top navbar or sidebar with:
       - App name ("BudgetPilot")
       - Placeholder links for "Overview", "Transactions", "Budgets", "Settings"
     - A main content area that shows:
       - A simple welcome message
       - A brief note like "Future: this page will show your spending overview, budgets, and bank accounts"
   - Use reusable components where it makes sense, such as:
     - <Navbar />
     - <Sidebar />
     - <DashboardShell />

5. DEV EXPERIENCE
   - Ensure the code is organized and readable for a beginner.
   - Add comments in the key files explaining:
     - What the file is responsible for
     - How the layout and routing work
   - If you add any scripts or commands (like `dev`, `build`), make sure package.json is correct.

6. Apply a **starter visual style inspired by Apple's new "liquid glass" UI**:
   - Soft, frosted effects
   - Subtle gradients
   - Blurred glass containers
   - Rounded corners and layered depth
   - Smooth animations and opacity transitions
   - Minimal color, mostly neutrals with subtle tints

This does NOT need to be perfect yet — just a **stylistic direction**. Use Tailwind to configure reusable utility classes and base styles.

=== STYLE AND COMMENTING GUIDELINES ===

- Use TypeScript everywhere.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Use clear names like `DashboardShell`, `Sidebar`, `Navbar`.
- Add short comments at the top of important files explaining their purpose.
- Add a small `README` section in the main README file that explains:
  - How to run the project locally
  - What pages currently exist
  - That this is Step 1 of a multi-step project (auth, DB, Plaid will come later)

=== HOW TO INTERACT WITH ME ===

When I ask you to "update something for Step 1" you should:
- Edit or create the relevant files.
- Explain briefly (in a comment or a short note) what changed and why.

When we are done with Step 1 I will explicitly tell you we are moving to Step 2 (auth and database). Until then, do not add any authentication, database code, or bank API integration. Focus on a clean scaffold.

Now, in this repo, set up everything described above for Step 1.
Start by assuming this is a fresh project and show me the files you create or modify along the way.
